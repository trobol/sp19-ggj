git branch			Checks list of branches and the current branch you are working on
git branch [branch_name]		Creates a new branch based on the last commit, but remains on the same branch
git checkout [branch_name]		Switches to a different branch
git checkout -b [branch_name]		creates and switches to a different branch
git log --graph --all		Shows the history of the project in detail
git push											Sends code to current branch of origin remote
git push [remote]									" to branch of same name on remote
git push [remote] [branch]							" to branch of different name
git push [remote] [local_branch] : [remote_branch}	" from a local branch to a remote branch

To Merge Branches:
git fetch
git rebase -i origin/master
//replace 'pick' with 's' for all but the top commit and close window, then write commit message and exit the rebase tool
git checkout master
git merge [branch_name]
git push origin master
git push origin : [branch_name]			This is deleting the branch that you were working on
git branch -d [branch_name]
